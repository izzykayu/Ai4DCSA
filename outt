{"sentence": Applicant is 36 years old and has worked for a major defense contractor as a cyber security engineer since September 2018. After graduating from high school, Applicant studied for one year (July 2003-June 2004) at the U.S. Military Academy Preparatory School, which is also known as West Point Prep. This education constituted active-duty service in the Army. He did not continue his education at West Point and was honorably discharged from the Army. He earned a bachelor’s degree in August 2007 and began working for a major defense contractor (E1) in November 2007 as an information assurance engineer. He also continued his studies and earned two master’s degrees, one in December 2013 and a second in April 2015, and a Ph.D. in March 2021. He was first granted a security clearance in about November 2007 and has continuously maintained his eligibility. He has lived with his girlfriend since 2017. They have no children. (Tr. at 20-21; GE 2 at 14; AE C.) Applicant’s last day of work at E1 was August 30, 2018. He had previously given notice of his intent to resign his position at that company and had accepted a position with his current employer (E2). In the afternoon of his last day of work, he downloaded over 15,000 files onto his personal USB external hard drive (USB Device), and when he left the employer’s premises, he took the USB Device with him. On September 4, 2018, investigators at E1 were alerted to this unusual downloading activity by a departing employee and investigated the circumstances. (GE 3 at 1.) The investigators found that the file path for the downloaded files was titled “Personaldocs\[E1].” They issued a memorandum to Applicant (the E1 Memorandum), dated September 6, 2018, even though he no longer worked there. Applicant signed the E1 Memorandum the next day, acknowledging receipt, and returned it to the investigators."} allennlp predict https://storage.googleapis.com/allennlp-public-models/fine-grained-ner.2021-02-11.tar.gz -
